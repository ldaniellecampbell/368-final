	<h1>About Multifacted</h1>
	<article class="about">

	<p>Multifaceted is a street and online campaign created by Lauren Campbell to promote, uplift and redefine how black women identify themselves. The current climate for black women within the United States is unhealthy, dismissive and limiting. This is primarily because of the preconceived notions of what black 
women are, aren’t, and can’t be.</p>
	<p>This definition stems from others who have historically held power over black women. This power makes these groups feel 
that they have the right to define a black women. This project is to provide a platform in which black women are encouraged to discover and define themselves as they see fit without the consideration, input or expectations of other groups.</p>
	<p>Multifaceted’s intended audience is comprised of young adults, who identify as both black and female; who actively participate in social media such as YouTube, Facebook, Tumblr and other interactive blog websites.</p>
	<p>Multifaceted’s print campaign will consist of a series of posters, both formal and informal, directing the viewer to the website while simultaneously challenging the way that the viewer thinks about their definition of black women. The online campaign will consist of a website were women can submit questions, watch and upload videos talking about their experiences and share their own personal definitions as it relates to them. It will also feature notable black women sharing their own definitions and resources for further discussion on the ever evolving individuals we collectively call black women.</p>
